The purpose of this vault is to provide an example of how I use Obsidian for project and task management.

I was inspired by so much of the great work done by the Obsidian community in creating dynamic, connected notemaking systems (most especially Nick Milo's Linking Your Thinking), and began customizing my Obsidian workflow to streamline things for me. 

Most importantly I wanted a way to get an at-a-glance view of a project (or Effort), showing up-to-date information on task status, meetings, and team members. It was also important that I be able to take notes anywhere in my vault (on my Daily Note, a meeting notes page, etc.) and have things automatically link back to the right project page. Finally, I didn't want to have to remember a bunch of different tags or designations to identify all the pieces of a project, so it had to prompt me and automatically fill in the information correctly and consistently every time.

There are several different ways you can accomplish the same goal, and many times it comes down to personal preference (e.g., I personally prefer to use properties instead of tags, but you might prefer using tags). Where possible I provide examples using different methods so that you can experiment and use the approach that works best for you.

### Plug-ins and themes used:
- Obsidian Tasks plug-in
- Folder Notes
- Style Settings plug-in (required for Prism theme)
- Prism theme

### Hotkeys used:
`Ctrl-Alt-P` - use the selected text to create a new project with that name. If no text is selected, you will be prompted to enter the name of a new one. 
`Ctrl-Alt-M` - use the selected text to create a new meeting note with that name. If no text is selected, you will be prompted
`Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P` - assign the current task to a new or existing project. You'll be prompted to select/create a project, and the script just inserts the project name at the cursor. Note this doesn't work inside the Task plugin popup.

### Explore the demo vault:
Check out the [[Taxonomy diagram]] and the [[Example with notes]] canvas notes to get a feel for how things are connected. There's more detail in [[Behind-the-scenes details]], and all of the scripts and templates are in the templates folder.

These collection notes will let you easily navigate around the vault:
