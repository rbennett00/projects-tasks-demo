The purpose of this vault is to provide an example of how I use Obsidian for project and task management.

There are several different ways you can accomplish the same goal, and many times it comes down to personal preference (e.g., I personally prefer to use properties instead of tags, but you might prefer using tags). Where possible I provide examples using different methods so that you can experiment and use the approach that works best for you.

### Plug-ins and themes used:
- Obsidian Tasks plug-in
- Folder Notes
- Style Settings plug-in (required for Prism theme)
- Prism theme

### Hotkeys used:
`Ctrl-Alt-P` - use the selected text to create a new project. If no text is selected, you will be prompted
`Ctrl-Alt-M` - use the selected text to create a new meeting note. If no text is selected, you will be prompted
`Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P` - assign the current task to a new or existing project. You'll be prompted to select/create a project, and the script just inserts the project name at the cursor. Note this doesn't work inside the Task plugin modal.
