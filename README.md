The purpose of this vault is to provide an example of how I use Obsidian for project and task management.

There are several different ways you can accomplish the same goal, and many times it comes down to personal preference (e.g., I personally prefer to use properties instead of tags, but you might prefer using tags). Where possible I provide examples using different methods so that you can experiment and use the approach that works best for you.

Plug-ins and themes used:
Obsidian Tasks plug-in
Folder Notes
Style Settings plug-in (required for Prism theme)
